# CrAsteroid

## Project overview
### Concept
In CrAsteroids, you play as a **super spaceship**, equipped with a **shock wave** capable of **blocking and blasting asteroids** away in just a blink of an eye. **Your mission** is to clean up the universe by blasting asteroids into a laser. Be aware, space is dangerous as asteroids can appear anywhere around you and your fuel supply is limited.

## How to play?
**On Windows**
The executable game file (.exe) is at:
Project root/Packaged/V4

**On other platforms**
A link to a HTML build of the game is at:
Project root/Packaged/HTML build.txt

## Development
### Overview
CrAsteroid was developed for an assignment in one of my game design unit. I was given approximately 1 week to design and build the game from start to finish. 
As the assignment was centred around the design aspect of game development, I put more emphasis on the design of CrAsteroid and less on its aesthetic. My target was a functional, low fidelity prototype.
